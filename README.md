# Interactorz

Interactorz is a standalone project to prototype features for my standalone unreal 5 plugins. It is a basic interaction mechanic that's common in most single player action/adventure RPGs, featuring interaction system with non-player actors, inventory system, item authoring tools, and many more to come. It is planned to be implementable in both C++ and Blueprint.
